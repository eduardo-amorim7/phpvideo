#### About the project re-brand.
 Originally the open-source version was offered as YouPHPTube, and marketed as a YouTube Clone (after the popular video sharing site), we decided to rebrand our open-source audio video platform project from YouPHPTube to <strong>AVideo Platform</strong> which constitutes <strong>Audio Video Platform</strong>. In some plugins, forks, versions, modules, APIs, documentation, file names, there may be or have been reference to <a href="https://youphp.tube/" target="_blank">youphptube</a>, <a href="https://youphp.tube/plugins/" target="_blank">youphp.tube</a>, youtube clone, clone script, searchtube, adtube, showtube, searchmercials.

# AVideo Platform Open-Source Project

<img src="https://avideo.tube/website/assets/151/images/svg/balancing.svg"/>

#### (Management/Encoding/Storage)
1. Management Project(s): <a href="http://git.avideo.tube/" class="" target="_blank">AVideo Platform</a>
1. Encoding Project(s): <a href="http://git-encoder.avideo.tube/" class="" target="_blank">AVideo Encoder</a> & <a href="http://git-encoder-network.avideo.tube/" class="" target="_blank">AVideo Encoder Network</a> (Optional)
1. Storage Project(s): <a href="http://git-storage.avideo.tube/" class="" target="_blank">AVideo Storage</a>

Management life cycle is as follows; media is managed at the platform at 1, media is then uploaded to a temporary storage to be encoded at 2, then stored for broadcast at 3, then distributed to devices at 1 to be consumed.

# First thing...
I would humbly like to thank God for giving me the necessary knowledge, motivation, resources and idea to be able to execute this project. Without God's permission this would never be possible.

**For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.**
`Apostle Paul in Romans 11:36`

## This Software must be used for Good, never Evil. It is expressly forbidden to use AVideo Platform Open-Source to build porn sites, violence, racism, terrorism, or anything else that affects human integrity or denigrates the image of anyone.

## Now you can read the rest...

## Important Information

> Streamer can be installed on any Server, including Windows, but the encoder and Livestream should work fine on any Linux distribution. However we recommend Ubuntu 16+ without any kind of control panel.
> The problem with cPanel, Plesk, Webmin, VestaCP, etc. It's because we need full root access to install some libs, and maybe compile them. Another important point is that to make Livestream work, we need to compile Nginx and the control panels often prevent us from running the commands forcing the installation available only on your panel.

I donÂ´t want to read I just want you to show me how to install!!

<a href="https://encoder2.avideo.com/" target="_blank">View Public Encoder</a>
</div>

# Why do I need the Encoder?
You may want to install the encoder for a few reasons, such as, if you have a faster server than the public encoder server (which is likely to be the case), or if you'd like a private way of encoding your videos.

But, the installation is mandatory if you are using a private network. The public encoder will not have access to send the videos to your streamer site.

If your server does not have a public IP or uses an IP on some of these bands:
- 10.0.0.0/8
- 127.0.0.0/8 (Localhost)
- 172.16.0.0/12
- 192.168.0.0/16

Surely you need to install an encoder
